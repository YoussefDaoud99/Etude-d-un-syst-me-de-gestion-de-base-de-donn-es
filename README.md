This project is part of my training at Grenoble INP - Ensimag. The project was done in a team of five people.

The goal of the project is to put in practice the skills and the knowledge we have learnt in relational database management systems. 
In addition, this project is about programming an application using a multimedia database (through transactions). The development is done in **Java** using the **JDBC API**.

### Context

The Klex company wishes to offer a multimedia server accessible both by physical equipment – televisions, radios, connected speakers, etc. – only by client software – dedicated software, web clients, or standard clients via the DLNA protocol –
as are its competitors such as Emby, Filestage, or Kodi among others. Users should be able to organize their library as they wish by assigning categories to their media content (the list of categories is easily expandable).

Our task is to design and implement the database describing the multimedia files hosted on the server (movies or audio files), their contents, as well as the
characteristics of client equipment and software in order to optimize the distribution of content.
